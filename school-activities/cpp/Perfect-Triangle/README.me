# Star Pyramid Program (C++)

This program prints a pyramid made of stars `*` using nested loops.

## How It Works
- `height` controls how tall the pyramid is
- The first loop prints the rows
- The second loop prints spaces so the stars are centered
- The third loop prints the stars in each row

### Sample Output
    *
   * *
  * * *
 * * * *
* * * * *

## What I Learned
- How to use **for loops** more
- How nested loops work
- How to control spacing and alignment in console output
- How logic affects the shape that appears on screen
