# Sum of Natural Numbers (C++)

This program asks the user for a positive number `n`, then calculates the sum of all numbers from **1 to n**.

Example:
If the user enters `5`, the program will calculate:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

## How It Works
- The user types a number.
- A `while` loop keeps adding numbers one by one.
- The final total is displayed.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to use a **while loop**
- I learned how to add numbers step-by-step using a running total (sum)
- I understood why variables need to be initialized before using them
