# Pyramid of Asterisks (C++)

This program prints a simple **pyramid of asterisks** to the console. The height of the pyramid is determined by a variable `x`.

## Example Output

If `x = 5`, the output will be:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

## How It Works

1. The program initializes `x` as the pyramid height and `a` as the current row counter.
2. The **outer `while` loop** runs from 1 to `x`, controlling the rows.
3. For each row, the **inner `while` loop** prints the correct number of asterisks.
4. After printing the asterisks for a row, the program moves to the next line.

## Key Concepts Used

* **Nested `while` loops**: One loop controls rows, the other prints characters per row.
* **Variables initialization**: Properly initializing counters (`a` and `b`) is necessary to avoid logic errors.
* **Increment operators (`++`)**: Used to move to the next row or column in the pyramid.

## What I Learned

* How to **use nested `while` loops** for pattern printing.
* How to **increment variables** step by step in loops.
