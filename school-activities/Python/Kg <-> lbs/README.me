# Weight Unit Converter (Python)

This program converts weight between **kilograms (Kg)** and **pounds (lbs)** using accurate conversion formulas.

## How It Works
- The program asks the user to enter a weight.
- The user specifies the unit: 'K' for kilograms or 'L' for pounds.
- If the user enters 'K', the program converts kilograms to pounds using the formula:
    lbs = kg × 2.20462
- If the user enters 'L', the program converts pounds to kilograms using the formula:
    kg = lbs × 0.453592
- The program displays the converted weight rounded to **2 decimal places**.
- If the user enters an invalid unit, the program prints an error message.

### Sample Output
Weight: 70
(K)g or (L)bs: k
Weight in lbs: 154.32 lbs. Done!
